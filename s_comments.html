<div class="md"><p>Is there a sector you guys are looking at currently? I was eyeing up Infrastructure stocks since the bill, but am also considering Fintech and Financial Services (currently have Blend so let&#39;s see what comes off that) based on what the Fed supposedly intends to do with the interest rates.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Where are the people saying &quot;it always goes up, better to get in sooner rather than later&quot;?</p>

<p>Who would&#39;ve thunk they could have been mistaken!?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just don’t look at it</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why do you say that?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah I felt good barely losing anything yesterday but today’s premarket has been… oof.  </p>

<p>2 weeks of investing and man it really lets you learn a lot.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>you think it has reached the highest it will ever be in the coming years and decades? i think not....</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes.   It stands for long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) </p>

<p>Options with more than 9 months until expiration are considered LEAPS. They behave just like other options, so don’t let the term confuse you. It simply means that they have a long “shelf-life”.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I bought a little SNAP just to see.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>? That&#39;s been the case for like 6 months? In the UK they highly recommend pfizer to under 30s. This was the case when I got my vaccine in May.</p>

<p>Might be a new thing in Germany but I believe it&#39;s the been the case for other countries for a while.</p>
