so did evergrande default or not?
Keep an eye out for ASTS, guys. Basically an undervalued space company with 1000 patents that seeks to be StarLink for phones - where StarLink needs a big box to connect, AST Spacemobile will let your phone connect to its service like a normal carrier, and will work everywhere on the surface of the earth like on the ocean and in urban countries / areas, you name it. Everywhere.
It feels like things are starting to change a bit in the market. Poor earnings are starting to be really punished for a lot of the more speculative stocks. Gonna be an interesting 2022 I think.
DIS and PYPL holder here. Been a tough stretch.
I bought DIS in april at 184 üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Brutal report from PSFE. Oof. No position.
Wtf is wrong with psfe? -33% premarket!
Buying opportunity for Disney for long term?
Can‚Äôt decide to buy more AMD, Sofi, or Dis. All look too good especially Sofi with a high likelihood of a bank charter.
what the hell is wrong with Visa?
NVDA fuck yeah get up there you dirty stock
NVD uptick expected? Also any idea why $BLND is doing poorly post earnings?
DIS leaps will be choice at open
DIS is gonna crush me at open at this rate
Visa playing with my emotions for months. When in doubt, zoom out‚Ä¶she‚Äôll be a $300 stock one day. Just patience.
Buying more visa.
Boy I'm glad that I bought SoFi
What is up with all the bulls on Ford? Did I miss a story on this company or something?
All the stocks I wanted to buy and decided to wait instead are rallying.
Now I wait for PayPal do dip a little further. I still like the company and wanted to buy a week ago.
I think I should just pull the trigger now.
Is AMD a good choice to buy right now or is it overvalued at the moment because of the hype? I see that it went down 7% in the last day and am wondering if that would be a good time to buy in.
Take my energy PYPL
I just wanna buy more DIS now not like they're going anywhere
Guys, I just sold all my DIS at a 10% loss. 
This is a total newbie question‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve almost doubled my money in Tesla- I bought a small share a couple months ago‚Ä¶ with that‚Äôs going on w them I‚Äôm wondering if I should sell and take the gain or just keep holding for future growth‚Ä¶?
Anyone else eyeing the DIS dip? I've been eyeing it for a while, bullish on DSNP, but the valuation felt too high. This looks like a nice correction to finally get in on.
What is your view on RKLB long term? Do you see the company doing well?
Damn, I was thinking about "buying the dip" with DIS, but it's P/E ratio is almost 300.  Big yikes.
This week's method of shaking the tree is called "stagflation fears"...
Anyone else bullish on CMPS? Seen a lot of friends benefit from micro dosing and seems like it could be a great treatment for depression.
What are everyone‚Äôs buys today
Redeeming my sofi warrants for 11.50 per is looking pretty nice right now.
Paysafe teaching me a hard lesson.
Lets go tech
So glad I chose Sofi over Paysafe.  Paypal not so much.  Too much fintech...
Thank god my Disney shares got assigned 2 weekends ago. Wtf happened to the mouse???
Google and others building massive data centres in ireland, bloom Energy already supplies Google, perhaps news soon on this, just putting 2 and 2 together
When will we see the big post IPO RIVN dip?
Seems like 300 Dollar is the base now for Nvidia.
I had two chances to sell Disney at $200 and I got the most downvotes I have ever gotten in this sub for entertaining the idea :/
PaySafe WTF
I'm so fucked. BYND and DIS. Just watching my gains disappear. Sigh.
Is low volume a problem even if the company Is consistently making profits and ticking most of the right boxes?
Lol people be talking about how bad inflation is and how there should be a major crash... 
COKE has been on fire!
What is zoom doing to save itself? They have competition, are basically a pure play and have no moat. What are they doing other than just taking the losses?
ASTS up a nice 4%
Paysafe FML
I knew I should have sold DIS. When the bull case on stock subs was dont bet against the mouse.
PYPL gonna continue to bleed me out
Owning DIS is like having parents with unreasonably high expectations.
What happen to VRT? Jumped from 26.66 to ATH of 29.20 in pre-market?
Adding more BYND
Is anyone in on Fossil (Fosl)?
AGC
Boy am i glad i bought BLK when everyone said they were doomed cause of Evergrande.
Not gonna lie, was really hoping for another deep red day to buy some more today. Probably not gonna happen the way premarket is looking though.
Theres a reason why tech savvy South Korean taken a stake in bloom Energy, its the most efficient and best, watch for major new contracts, imo
SE continues to tank. No one knows why. Perfectly normal...
I know I‚Äôve see people post about YouTube before, came across this. 
I know people may not like me saying this but I don't mind PYPL going down right now....all these stocks have been flying and way overvalued. PYPL has been slowing going back down to earth, unlike these other stocks that are gonna have a rude awakening. It's still a great company who I just keep buying
I understand why people can justify companies like PayPal taking a giant hit (and still being overvalued). But how do you explain AFRM, a company that isn‚Äôt profitable, is a service that PayPal also offers, announces a deal with Amazon, and explodes.
Glad i went with my gut and didn‚Äôt buy Disney earlier in the year. People kept saying it was fair value bc of D+ but I believed marvel and star wars wouldn‚Äôt be enough to get the crazy numbers people were looking for so imo it was to overvalued at 180+.
[removed]
Anyone else but the 9:31 spike of SoFi to 24.60?
BW up 20% today would now be a good time to cash out or think it still has room to grow?
I have money in my fidelity account. But the buy order is still open, not complete. Is this because it's Veteran's day? 
I made a judgment call recently and sold PYPL at a small loss. I have SQ, SOFI, and COIN as my big individual fintech stocks in my growth portfolio right now. And I still have PYPL exposure in some ETFs. I just felt better about those other three longterm. We'll see how it goes.
Anyone done any DD on the VAXX IPO dropping today?
What are some good ETFs to get into right now?
The rich get rich the poor get poorer.
Wow some crazy dips today. 
Im so sick of these fake market corrections. It drops for 1 day and then immediatly goes back to ATH again. Whats the point in dropping if you are just gonna immediatly recover the next day anyway?
RIVN because fuck Tesla
Join us at r/byndinvest
I'll say it again: sell DIS or some and buy FUBO. The average analyst price target among the eight analysts covering FuboTV is $43.50, suggesting about 62.4% upside from current levels.
All these big companies are nothing without energy thats way bloom Energy should be valued tens of billions of dollars
So is the FUD over? Are we back to running up and up across the board?
No it was a spooky rumor
It‚Äôs definitely an interesting company. But fuck, it‚Äôs such a niche sector and I have literally no knowledge.
I am slowly building up with 5 to 10 shares / month
What is your position in this stock?
The mouse isn‚Äôt going anywhere
LOL march of last year. I was looking at Disney, dicks sporting goods and PayPal. I bought alot of PayPal (RIP) and bought and sold Disney a few times and made small profits but it didn't seem good enough to hold. .....I didn't buy dicks sporting good. Go look at their last 6mobths -1 year returns lol
Really was never sure why this "growth" stock got so much attention on here.
Major oof
If a stock doesn't triple beat expect it to be down 10-30% in the next couple trading days. 
Earnings and revenue guidance cut
Having not added in a while, I'm eyeballing it.
Sofi and AMD are both attractive as longterm holds. I'll be interested to see when DIS starts offering dividends again.
Not sure but SOFI + PYPL + BKKT are future. 
Starbucks just announced acceptance of Eth + Bt as payment
Delete app and windows. Reinstall in 5 years
I watched it at 14 in august and didn‚Äôt buy‚Ä¶ now I don‚Äôt know if I should still buy here or not
That's definitely one that people were hyping up a few months ago that actually paid off lol. Wish I'd bought more!
Ford is pursuing EV big-time
You've missed a lot, that's why the stock has doubled this year. I'm not awake enough yet to write a big thing but start by looking into Jim Farley.
Most institutional ratings are not pricing for the dividend reinstatement, yet.  Check that closely if you‚Äôre doing DD.  Could be ‚Äútechnically‚Äù undervalued until that‚Äôs official.  
I would . You'll be ahead of me 11%. Bought last week.
Is it a good long term buy right now?  Probably.
I think we gonna see AMD 200$ sooner than we think
I bought at 175 yesterday. Great timing! Plan to hold long term though so I‚Äôm not going to fret.
Actual good advice in /r/stocks thank you!
Depends on your goals. A good question to ask yourself, has anything changed in the company that makes you want to sale? Where else would you put the money?
I'm expecting it to fall more. But time in the market, etc...
I'm buying today. its a long term hold for me so a no brainer to average down.
I'm currently down about 12% on my holdings unfortunately, but yeah I still think it's a solid long term play and thinking about averaging down.
They seem to have the best moat in terms of small rockets to launch satellites. IMO, that's the most bullish area in my mind for space right now. Companies are talking about launching their own satellites constellation, like Boeing and Amazon. 
Expect bumps along the road IMO
At least it has a pe now.
People still look at P/E ratios without any context lmao. You are supposed to think about revenue growth going into the future. 
Yea I am in the same boat. My immediate reaction was to buy the dip...I've been waiting for it to drop below 169. I had no clue its PE ratio was so damn high. I thinking of DCA into it in case we have more disappointing earnings in the future.
Wow, just noticed that. TF? Is there a company in the same ballpark of market value with a worse PE?
I‚Äôm bullish on the idea, just worried about the time line. 
Spy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
EXFY 
ASPN
same here, I think the lesson is (1) don't buy SPACS or de-SPACS and (2) don't buy stuff promoted on Reddit if it's not a mega-cap already
I chose psfe üòî
Magic is fading
Patience
Yea. People kept saying dont bet against the mouse as if that was bullish.
Hindsight is 20/20. 
No words
DIS should be fine long-term, I hate the fake meat industry but BYND probably isn‚Äôt going anywhere either, or it‚Äôs an acquisition/merger target long term. I hope DIS not BYND
Selling your kid‚Äôs data I would guess?
I love this stock.
High risk unprofitable companies often times don't pay off
It's like 75% down from the highs of Jan. Very tempting....
Right, but AFRM is sky rocketing and they‚Äôre not even profitable. This market sucks
Be patient. It'll have its day soon. Just needs a little positive news and time for people to move on from earnings (which really weren't that bad just more of a transitory period)
It's always been a solid company, just had a little bad news recently with earnings & PINS. It's still a good long term investment
You do realize Disney is trading at a significantly higher multiple and all time highs despite going through a 1.5 year shut down right...the only way to maintain that absurd stock price is with rapid growth of a high margin segment like Disney + .... everyone acting like reopening should make the stock price go up when it was almost double the pre pandemic market cap DURINg the pandemic...I wouldn't blame the market for overpaying for a stock, valuations always matter in the end, even in this clown marker were currently in
You realize DIS is not the only game in town.
Feels like the APPL cult
Disney is a D+ student who everyone thinks is smart because everyone says they're smart, cheats (cough micky mouse act), and copies off netflix's homework from 5 years ago. I was trading them a few weeks ago on technicals and fucking bailed when I saw how trash their actual financials were. I feel stupid even touching them in the first place.
I'll wait for the dust to settle a little bit.
Lol great call bro
You gotta name which stocks. Giving such a generalized comment makes it seem 100% of stocks are up when there are some that are red right now. That can still be dip bought though 2 red days some call those falling knives.
-0.67% ?
It's a stupid market. That's all I have. I don't take the people who say they're not buying into PYPL because it's still really overvalued seriously. They probably have all this real overvalued shit in their portfolio.
Good call! I had DIS briefly but sold. I recommend FUBO for streaming service stock
I don‚Äôt understand how YouTube competes in that space. Are people just going to stop watching TV shows? Their content exists for different audiences imo.
82M market cap? Seems very speculative to me . How is it a Nasdaq stock?
Sorry - the post you're trying to make mentions a stock that currently breaks rule #7.
No . But it's at 23.68, super close
If the 20% is without reason, yes.
The market is open. Somebody has to sell you the shares.
No idea, but I'm able to trade today. I also use Fidelity.
Most brokers are filling orders today, they‚Äôre just not doing settlements.
It‚Äôs called weekly fluctuations lol. A market correction hasn‚Äôt happened this year to big stocks‚Ä¶
So we're saying "fake corrections" instead of "red days" now?  Interesting, this could be fun.  Language is such a fascinating thing.
Are you complaining about making money?? I'm confused
Nothing fake for me. 10% down yesterday. 18K . My biggest drop ever. I didn't panic though. A few days like that would be a different story
F is just sitting there killing it and you're gonna buy RIVN over $100b
Why would cord cutters go to fubo? It's $65 a month for their cheapest plan. 
no it's called market fluctuation.
but then i heard that being a rumor was a rumor. did someone buy puts then make fake news?
It did !
It definitely is! The DD boils is down to terms understandable to guys like us. You could always put in a few bucks just to follow the ride.
Nice. Would say you have until March to get it cheap,  so plenty of time
15% of my portfolio. It's the only single stock I own, otherwise ETFs and some coins. I haven't had a single company convince me this much since I bought Enphase in November 2019.
Neither are going anywhere‚Äîjust been a tough stretch is all.
Which is pretty much suicide for a company like this which is purely valued on high growth speculation. To add to your point.
Back in March I did a few hours of DD an put a price target of 145-150 on it.  I may have to update that to see if I still like them there.
Your future (PYPL) is not doing so hot either.
Im sorry. I hope you are positive sooner rather than later man.
But I don‚Äôt want to compare myself for others. I‚Äôm still learning to DD for myself and it‚Äôs hard
Yeah I wonder more now that there are so many companies expanding their electric vehicles if ultimately Tesla won‚Äôt be able to hold onto its place in the market. I‚Äôd probably take the money and invest in Rivian as there could be more short term growth potential for them. Ultimately I‚Äôm more focused on long term growth anyway and don‚Äôt plan on selling and withdrawing money for a while‚Ä¶
Yeah it's def a risky industry, but it does seem like the company does have a lot of promise. I bought some shares of the company for long term holding, more of a spec play for me, but it does seem more solid than SPCE would be
That‚Äôs to be expected with space stocks so understandable.
Up to a point (and I am long Disney), but even with growth companies, there's a limit to how extreme the P/E ratio can be before it should be off-putting to an investor.
I found all my big winners from Reddit.  But the past year I have found nothing but losers.
Same so rough
Easier said than done. Starting to wish I had jumped in yesterday.
haha i remember that spam dont bet against the mouse.
I totally get it. I just wish I followed my gut - though, to be fair, if I always did that, I'd probably be broke
With little to no revenue growth at that.
If AGC is a SPAC it's too high to get in IMO
I wanted the whole NASDAQ to be down again to buy more TQQQ.
No, they don't have to "name which stocks" and nor is it a generalize comment that makes it seem like 100% of stocks are up lmao.
These people are going to be freaking out when the market finally corrects.  I actually can't wait lol.  It's now at -0.15 Good Heavens!  The sky is falling!
Before you chime in with a smartass comment, look at its performance over the last week or so...
I just added to my position a little, thankfully not a huge order. It‚Äôs a long hold for me so no real worries.
It's on the heels of a better than expected earnings report but still seems like there is more to the story
Yes there was it happened in September/October.
People learn the lingo and don't understand it, they just use it for the things they think it looks like. Like saying typography when they mean typedesign. It's just noobs, really.
He bought at ATH then sold at the bottom of the turbulence and now he's angry
Never said I wasn‚Äôt in F
It's growing more than DIS .
We have FUBO shared with 3  but pay very little for Comcast .
NFLX + Hulu + HBO shared too
Yeah, so listen - between you and me I did it. But do NOT tell anyone I could get in a shit load of trouble. I‚Äôm going to do it again today but dont. Tell. Anyone.
Ok thanks for your answer :) I'm always a little sceptic when it comes to comments like this, I always assume soneone has a lot of calls for the stock.
May I ask, how does on determin such a number. I m learning about stocks and I am starting to get all the different values and what they could mean, but I have yet to figure out hiw people determin such a price target. Is there a mathematical formula for this?
Growing pains
Thx. I like MSFT + FUBO + SOFI + LCID + TWLO + IONQ + AEHR 
Just my opinion, I don't see space tourism being that big of an industry. I see the best play being the satellites. They are able to make cubestat's, enabling more companies to launch satellites.
Feel the market fundamentally changed this past year. Such a crap shoot
Oh ok you made it sound like you were looking at multiple stocks not an index/ETF. In the individual stock space there are many that have had at least 2 red days in a row. If you in an index you can easily not notice that.
You don't understand you clown! Going up 700% in the last year is underperforming the market! I bet you actually zoom out on a chart like some kind of degenerate instead of only looking at day to day movement.
It went up 20% in 7 days in October, its consolidating.
1M up 5.5%....
eh, if you are trading then I'd sell, but if you're invested and have been for a while I'd hold. Depends on your strat
I‚Äôm sorry but a 5.42% drop in SPY from absolute high in August / September to absolute low in October is not a correction. A correction is between 10%-20%. Not trying to be mean but I'm praying for you when a real correction or crash happens
You mean every stock that goes up isn't getting short squeezed?
I would hope it's growing faster than Disney.
secrets safe with me.
No calls, only shares. I have no idea when it will get big, but I know we‚Äôre in the early adopter phase. Genuinely just sharing my excitement!
Thanks man. I‚Äôll have a look later! Definitely safed.
Im also especially bullish on MSFT. Every company I work with uses azure. Also a Stock i want to buy in.
Thanks again.
It's tanking upward, duh!
All you people are clowns. It has underperformed the market, and that's a fact. I'm saying that there has been no news to warrant its slip. Keep going, moron.
????
I imagine that the Banks and China are being very transparent....nothing to see here....move along
I have about 100 shares right now. Wanting to get to 175-200 by March when BW3 is supposed to launch.
Good luck. I'm a mom but no worries.
Inflation report that came out yesterday...
Oh damn. I‚Äôm sorry, I somehow assume most people on Reddit are men. My apologies, m‚Äòam.
You're right . I think so too
