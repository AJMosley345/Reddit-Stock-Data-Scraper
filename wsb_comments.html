If there was an inverse leveraged WSB ETF, I would seriously consider making that 100% of my portfolio
China Evergrande Group once again averted a default with a last-minute payment of coupons on three dollar bonds before the 30-day grace period ended. It comes amid wider speculation that the crackdown on the property market in China is starting to ease, with a series of articles published in state media signaling support measures may be on the way. A gauge of real estate stocks jumped 5.7% overnight and high-yield dollar bonds rose. Despite the increased optimism on a resolution to the problems, the wider fallout from slowdown in the Chinese property market is clear.
I sent spy a ‚Äúu up‚Äù text, got a multimedia file in response and was out the door before I got my second shoe on.
My favorite thing about trading is when my option makes money and Im unable to sell so I hold the next day for a big loss.
I don't even have time for the bullshit anymore. I see green I sell everything at open and end my day.

If I made just $100 a day, I could live off the market. Why must we be so easily succumbed to greed and lose it all trying to hit that 10 bagger? 
It‚Äôs disappointing Spy not at $470 I guess we have to wait till close
Futes look good. Glad I spent yesterday panic holding instead of panic selling.
My 4hr chart SPY looks like the same set up from October's dip. Are we expecting a red day or finally another 2-3 day pump. If it follows a similar trend, it should be at 475 EOW. Nearly all SPY stocks are green pre-market except GOOG. By all metrics that I can see, SPY should be a green pump day and our bullish trend should continue after that mega drop.
